          <p>
            The Davis-Tennon Foundation is committed to driving meaningful change
            by funding initiatives that address critical needs within Rhode Island
            communities. Our goal is to empower individuals and families, remove
            barriers to opportunity, and create lasting solutions for underserved
            populations.

              <p>
                In light of the current social, economic, and political climate, the Davis-Tennon Foundation is placing renewed emphasis on supporting basic human needs in the communities we serve. While we continue to value long-term programming and operational support, our current funding priorities are focused on immediate, tangible needs that directly impact the health, safety, and stability of individuals and families—particularly in historically underserved communities.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Access to safe and stable housing</li>
                <li>Emergency food assistance</li>
                <li>Hygiene and essential household items</li>
                <li>Support for survivors of domestic violence</li>
                <li>Critical student and family support outside school hours</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We believe that meeting these fundamental needs is an essential foundation for growth, healing, and opportunity—and that in this moment, responsiveness, equity, and dignity must guide our funding decisions. If your organization is addressing basic needs in Rhode Island, especially in or around Central Falls, we encourage you to submit a Letter of Intent during our current funding cycle.
